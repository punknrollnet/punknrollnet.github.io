        <link><![CDATA[https://punknroll.net/merchandise/kreuzberg-61-black/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This design shows &#8220;Kreuzberg&#8221; and a large number 61 in a college style font. Until 1993 Germany used a 4 digit post code. Berlin was 1000 and part of the district Kreuzberg was 61, a neighborhood known for its punk and alternative scenes. It is for people who have lived or stayed in Berlin Kreuzberg and hopefully have good memories worth being nostalgic about. • Also buy this artwork on apparel, stickers, phone cases, and more.</p>
