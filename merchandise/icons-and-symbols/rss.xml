            <p>A five-pointed and filled star (★) is an important symbol mostly associated with communist ideology, but also cultural movements like punk. The star has been widely used in flags of countries like Cuba, China and the former USSR, state emblems, monuments, ornaments, and logos. This design simply consists of a red star and is available on black and dark color products.</p>
